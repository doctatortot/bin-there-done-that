# bin-there-done-that
   


A sysadmin’s personal graveyard of hacks, helpers, one-liners, and scripts that probably shouldn’t work — but absolutely do.

This is where the magic happens:
- 🔧 Server bootstraps
- 📦 ZFS snapshot management
- 🧼 Cron-powered cleanup rituals
- ☠️ Disaster recovery with no disasters (yet)
- 🐢 Slow rsyncs. Fast regrets.

> **Status:** In production. Against better judgment.

## ⚙️ Highlights

- `pull_health_everywhere.sh` – because you can’t fix what you don’t know is broken
- `dr_spl_overlay.sh` – tape drive energy for modern times
- `fix_mastodon_perms.sh` – chown your sins away
- `validate_zfs_snapshots.sh` – trust but verify (and scrub)
- `freezer.sh` – it's like a backup, but colder

## 📌 Philosophy

- Flat files > Object storage  
- ZFS is life  
- Automation is king  
- Users lie and take up space

## 🧠 Use at your own risk

This repo is for *me*. If you find it useful, cool. If it destroys your cluster, you probably shouldn’t have been copying scripts from a repo with this name anyway.
